# hello-world
This is the beginning of my coding, programming and web development journey. So excited!

Call me Ewurama.
I have started learning nice stuff on Pluralsight. Mobile web development is indeed very interesting. I just love it.
Trust me, I ain't gonna give up. Cos this is the next best thing to happen to me.
